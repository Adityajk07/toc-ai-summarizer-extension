# TOC Summarizer AI — V2

A next-generation browser extension that summarizes complex Terms & Conditions using Google Gemini and verifies accuracy using OpenAI embeddings to produce a confidence score. With one click, the extension extracts legal text from any webpage, summarizes it, compares it across two AI models, and shows you how reliable the summary is.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Dual-Model AI Summaries**  
  Gemini for primary summarization → OpenAI for verification.

- **Confidence Scoring**  
  Computes cosine similarity between Gemini and OpenAI summaries and displays it visually.

- **Secure Local Proxy Architecture**  
  No API keys are ever stored in the extension. All keys stay inside a local `.env` file on your machine.

- **Advanced Extraction Engine**  
  Handles dynamic pages, SPAs, iframes, and performs multi-pass extraction with fallbacks.

- **Modern Futuristic UI**  
  React + Tailwind, Tron-inspired visuals.

- **Chromium Compatible**  
  Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera.

## 🧠 How It Works

User clicks button
→ content.js extracts text from webpage
→ background.js sends extracted text to local proxy
→ server.js:
1) Summarizes with Gemini
2) Generates secondary summary with OpenAI
3) Computes embeddings for both summaries
4) Calculates similarity → confidence score
→ popup displays summary + confidence bar

API keys never enter the browser context.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

- API keys stored ONLY in: `local_proxy/.env`
- `.env` is safely ignored by `.gitignore`
- Extension communicates only with:
  - `http://localhost:<PORT>/proxy/gemini`
  - `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/verify-with-openai`
- No secrets in:
  - `background.js`
  - `content.js`
  - `popup.jsx`

Safe to publish on GitHub.

- Webpack  
- Chrome Extensions API (Manifest V3)

**Backend**

## ⚙️ Development Setup (For Developers)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adityajk07/toc-ai-summarizer-extension.git
cd toc-ai-summarizer-extension
2. Install frontend dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Install backend dependencies
bash
Copy code
cd local_proxy
npm install
4. Create .env inside local_proxy/
ini
Copy code
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
PORT=3000
You can obtain your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
Copy it into .env using the format above.

5. Start build watchers
Tailwind:

bash
Copy code
npm run watch:css
Webpack/React:

bash
Copy code
npm run watch
6. Start the local proxy server
bash
Copy code
cd local_proxy
node server.js
7. Reload the extension via chrome://extensions
⚠️ Important Note About OpenAI Verification
This version (V2) uses OpenAI embeddings for the confidence score.
If you do not have paid OpenAI credits, you can:

✔️ Use V1, which relies solely on Gemini
✔️ V1 requires only a Gemini API key
✔️ V1 is available in the previous commit

V1 is ideal for:

Students

Free-tier users

Anyone without OpenAI API access
